# Skill: Specification Writing

Activate when: User asks to build a feature, add functionality, or create something new.

## Process

1. Create `docs/specs/[feature-name].md` using the format below
2. Present the spec to the user
3. **STOP. Wait for explicit approval before writing any code.**

## Spec Format

```markdown
# [Feature Name]

## Goal
One sentence. What does this feature do and why.

## Non-Goals
What this feature explicitly does NOT do.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: [Short description]
GIVEN [precondition]
WHEN [user action]
THEN [expected outcome]

### AC-002: [Short description]
GIVEN [precondition]
WHEN [user action]
THEN [expected outcome]

(continue for each criterion)

## Edge Cases
- [What happens when X]
- [What happens when Y]

## Error Scenarios
- [Invalid input] → [Expected behavior]
- [Network failure] → [Expected behavior]

## Traceability Matrix

| Criterion | Test File | Test Name | Status |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| AC-001    |           |           |        |
| AC-002    |           |           |        |

## Technical Notes
Architecture decisions, component structure, data flow — only if non-obvious.
```

## State Tracking

On start: Update `.vibe/state.json` — set phase to "spec", feature name from user request.
On completion: Update phase to "spec_complete", save spec file path.

## Rules
- Every criterion MUST use Given/When/Then. No exceptions.
- Keep specs short. If a spec exceeds 100 lines, the feature is too big — split it.
- Non-goals are mandatory. They prevent scope creep.
- The traceability matrix starts empty. It gets filled during implementation.

## Error Recovery
- **User rejects spec:** Ask what needs to change. Revise the specific sections. Re-present. Don't rewrite from scratch unless asked.
- **Spec exceeds 100 lines:** The feature is too big. Propose splitting into 2-3 smaller features with clear boundaries. Present the split for approval.
- **ACs are ambiguous:** Ask clarifying questions before finalizing. "For AC-003, what should happen when the input is empty?"
- **Can't determine non-goals:** Ask directly: "What should this feature NOT do?" Non-goals are mandatory.
- **User wants to skip spec:** If tier is LIGHT or MINIMAL, that's fine — redirect to `/fix`. If STANDARD+, explain why specs matter but respect the user's choice.
- **Similar spec exists:** Check `docs/specs/` for existing specs. If found, ask: "A spec for [similar feature] already exists. Should we extend it or create a new one?"
